# Shopping-Basket
This is a small project included in the Udemy Java Course which made particular use of ‘Maps’ within Java to imitate how an online stock list and shopping basket would work. 
Stock items and their price can be created. These items can then be added to a stock list which keeps track of the quantity in stock and the total value of the items and 
stock list. Items in the stock list can then be put into a shopping basket which shows a list of the items purchased and the total cost of the basket. 
As items are sold, the quantity and total value of the stock list is updated.
